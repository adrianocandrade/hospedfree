    <p class="mb-6">Welcome to the {{ config('app.name') }}. Before getting started, we need some information on the database. You will need to know the following items before proceeding.</p>
    <ol class="mb-6 list-inside list-decimal">
        <li>Database host</li>
        <li>Database name</li>
        <li>Database username</li>
        <li>Database password</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mb-6">Most likely these items were supplied to you by your Web Host. If you don’t have this information, then you will need to contact them before you can continue.</p>
    <p>Installer will insert this information inside a configuration file so your site can communicate with your database.</p>
    <p>Need more help? Review the local project documentation in the <code>docs/</code> directory.</p>
